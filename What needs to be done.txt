The responsiveness needs to be improved. 
Right now, the text area is too small; 
it should be a normal size like when the user logs in. 
Also, when another user creates a room, it should appear 
immediately in the left chatrooms window without requiring a refresh. 
Users should be able to join directly, 
and the joined usersâ€™ names should appear as 'joined' 
when they enter a chatroom and show as 'disconnected' when they leave.
